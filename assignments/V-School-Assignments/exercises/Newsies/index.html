        <h2>Winter is Coming!</h2>

        <strong>Winter. Is. Coming.</strong> 

        <p>Take care to winterize your swamp cooler, sprinklers, and hoses.
        Ensure your hoses are disconnected from your house, so you don't damage the pipes.</p>

        <p>Now is the time to purchase winter tires. When the snow is coming down it will be too late!</p>
        
        <p>Also, now is a great time to refresh your emergency kits in your vehicles. That way you can help yourself or someone else in an emergency.</p>
        
        <span>Have a great winter!</span>
